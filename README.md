# Introduction

This game is an automation game inspired by Vectorio, Factorio and my physics passions

## Lore

The goal of the game is to produce as much energy as possible, and not getting destroyed by monsters.

## Ennemy Lore (humans)

Scientists create a bit of antimatter in a lab, no ones knows why, but the antimatter starts to take differents shapes and starts making more elaborate materials. Scientists then continue feeding the antimatter, and after a while, the antimatter shoots a beam of antimatter in space.
Scientists know they F'up, but how much ? A few years later, they find a big antimatter factory near some asteroids, humanity then starts attacking this factory, and also starts developping new and stronger weapons. After a while, the war becomes inter galactic, then in different galaxies. After even more time, humanity finds out how to go to other universes ! Maybe they will be able to escape the antimatter cataclysm ? When they find antimatter waiting for them in another universe, they understand wherever you can go, you will find antimatter, and they need to stop there expansion, or they won't have any more resources to survive !


### Producing energy

When you start the game, you are being fed by a strange photon beam. With this energy (in the form of photons), you will want to make "matter", like atoms and other bigger elements.
You can make different machines for every fermions, and if you want to know more about any particle, check Wikipedia: [Fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion)


### Monsters

The monsters are made of antimatter. They are pretty strong, because when they touch any of your infrastructure, both the monster and a part of your base explodes
